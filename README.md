#Current Progress of Breakout

* Fulfilled targets:

	1. brick layouts of 3 levels
	2. 3 types of bricks
	3. first 2 functions of paddle
	4. 3 status display
	5. splash screen

* Targets changed or discarded:

	1. The paddle speed in all 3 levels are set to be same without powerups. Because in this initial speed the paddle doesn't move very fast.
	2. In level 3, there are no gaps between adjacent bricks. For simplicity.
	3. Change the paddle function 1 to "bounce back in the original direction for the middle thirds of paddle, and to bounce normally in the left and right thirds of the paddle". The visual effect looks more reasonable.
	4. Remove sound effect. Without enough time.
	
* Targets to be fulfilled:

	1. the class `Powerup`
	2. the collision between paddle and powerups
	3. the effects of each powerup
	4. cheatkeys
