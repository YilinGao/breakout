#Current Progress of Breakout

* Fulfilled targets:

	1. brick layouts of 3 levels
	2. 3 types of bricks
	3. ball speed random initialization
	4. first 2 functions of paddle	
	5. 4 types of power-ups
	6. 3 status display
	7. 3 types of cheat keys
	8. splash screen
	9. restart button at the result page
	10. When starting a new life, start from the original place.
	11. Press `SPACE` to pause and restart during the game.

* Targets changed or discarded:

	1. The paddle speed in all 3 levels are set to be same without powerups. Because in this initial speed the paddle doesn't move very fast.
	2. In level 3, there are no gaps between adjacent bricks. For simplicity.
	3. Change the paddle function 1 to "bounce back in the original direction for the middle thirds of paddle, and to bounce normally in the left and right thirds of the paddle". The visual effect looks more reasonable.
	4. Remove sound effect. Without enough time.
	5. Change the function of the first type of power-up `S` to increase the speed of ball.
	6. Change the name of the second type of power-up from `M` to `B`.
	7. Change the cheat key `SPACE` into `B`. Because `SPACE` is responsible for starting the ball.
